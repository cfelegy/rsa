# RSA
A toy implementation of the RSA algorithm using Rust

### Motivation
This is merely meant to be a rough installation of the algorithm after brief discussion in an undergraduate intro to abstract mathematics course. The code herein is meant to be experimental and not a reflection of security or efficiency.
